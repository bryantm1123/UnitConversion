# UnitConversion

This package is a simple wrapper around some of the conversions provided by the native [Measurement API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/measurement). So far it covers conversions for temperature, distance, and time. Also contains a custom converter for converting between 12 hour and 24 hour clock time.
